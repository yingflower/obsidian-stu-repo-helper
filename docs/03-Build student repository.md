# Building a Student Knowledge Repository

Building a knowledge repository is a long-term process. The function of the Student knowledge repository Helper plugin is to simplify some of the cumbersome operations encountered during this process, allowing students to use the saved time for learning. Next, we will introduce some common operations in the process of building the knowledge repository.

## One-click Conversion of Examination Paper Images
After uploading the images of examination papers to the student knowledge repository, we can convert them into Obsidian notes with just one click, completing the digital archiving of the examination papers, which is convenient for subsequent querying and analysis. The operation method is shown in the following figure:
