# Personal Knowledge Repository -- External Storage of the Human Brain

During everyone's growth process, we accumulate a large number of memories, and these memories gradually converge into a personal "knowledge repository" that is exclusive to each individual. However, the storage capacity of the human brain is limited, and it cannot store all information without limit. Therefore, we need to rely on external storage to carry these memories. If we can achieve the ability to access and retrieve information at any time as needed, then the brain and the external knowledge repository can work in tandem, greatly expanding our memory capacity. This is precisely the original intention of developing this knowledge repository assistant plugin. Although its functions are still relatively basic at present, we will continue to work hard and keep moving towards this goal.

Next, taking the construction of a student knowledge repository as an example, we will show you how to create a personalized knowledge repository based on Obsidian. A typical student knowledge repository usually consists of the following parts:

Study Records: It covers the study materials of each course, such as examination papers, notes, important documents, etc.
Daily Records: It includes the records of extracurricular activities such as painting and handicrafts.

Here is an example of the composition of a typical student knowledge repository directory:
```shell
├── 01_Chinese
│   ├── 4a
│   │   ├── Composition
│   │   │   ├── A Trip to Hongcun Together.md
│   │   │   └── The Day of Announcing Grades.md
│   │   └── Examination Papers
│   │       ├── Exercises for Units 3 and 4.md
│   │       └── Exercises for Units 5 and 6.md
│   └── _imgs
├── 02_Mathematics
│   ├── 4a
│   │   ├── Examination Papers

```

In the future, we will introduce how to use Obsidian and its plugins to build a student knowledge repository that can grow together with students.
